AI Prompt QA | Learning Web Dev & QA
Currently building projects using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and exploring AI integrations.

I enjoy front-end development and using my creativity to create unique user experiences. My goal is to build software that people enjoy using! 

I'm still learning and building my skillset. In the process, I use this space to document my projects and journey.
